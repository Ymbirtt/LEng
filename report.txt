The Flammable Pig compiler will Happily, Alexly and Haskelly compile all features
of the language stated on the assignment's webpage; arithmetic operators, 
variables, reassignments, read statements, conditionals and loops.

Due to the fact that the lab machines do not have a fully working and up to date
version of the Haskell Platform, invoking "ghc flammablePig.hs" will not compile
the code which will be submitted with this report. The included makefile should
sort this out by invoking a slightly modified ghc script, where the absolute
reference to "/usr/bin/gcc44" is replaced with "$which gcc". This has been tested 
out on the lab machine "bagkok", but I can't vouch for every single computer. 
Also, invoking "alex lexer.x" and "happy parser.y" will also have no effect, 
since these Haskell utilites are not installed. Ideally the makefile should 
contain these commands, but instead I have provided the results of running these
utilities with the source code.
